# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Designed for users who track their calorie burn after various common forms of physical activity (jogging, push ups, planks, stair climbing, swimming, etc) and users who need to know how many minutes or repetitions of an activity/exercise to do to reach a calorie burning goal. Also allows users to input a number of reps/minutes for one exercise or activity and see how many reps/minutes they need to do another activity to achieve an equivalent number of burned calories.
